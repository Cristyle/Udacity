  <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <div>
      1. The web is a collection of HTML documents
    <br>
      2. HTML is an acronym that stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    <br>
      3. Url's are how to refer to documents on the web.
    <br>

  <h4>How Does The Internet Work?</h4>
    <p>Your computer uses a web browser to access the internet and retrieve
      the information you requested. Your webpage request is sent to the server
      where the information is being stored. The server retrieves the webpage
      informaton and sends the requested files back to your computer. Your
      web browser displays the information in a format you can read, and
      interact with. Below is a sketch of the basics of how the internet works.</p>

    <h4>What is HTML</h4>
      <p>HTML is the language web browsers know to display webpage information.
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML elements are tags that
        tell the browser how to interpret and display your information. There is
        almost always and opening and closing tag. Tags are enclosed by the less
        than (<) and greater than (>) sign. The closing tag has the same name as
        the opeing tag, but after the less than (<) symbol and before the name of
        the tag there is a forward slash (/) to indicate it's the end of the
        sentence. Some elements display the information inline, which means one
        continious of the information you entered. Other elements display the
        inforomation within an invisible box. These are block elements. Here is
        a list of the elements I've learned so far.</P>
      <h4>Inline Elements</h4>
          1. (<)br(>) tells the browswer to press return and create a new line.
        <br>
          2. (<)b(>) will <b>bold</b> any text between the opening and closing
          tag.
        <br>
          3. (<)em(>) will <em>italicize</em> any text between the opening and
          closing tag.
        <br>
          4. (<)img(>) is how you display an image. You'll need to give the
          location of the image you want to display and a discription of the
          image incase the user is blind and can't view the image.
        <br>
          5. (<)span(>) is an easy way to group inline elements.
        <br>
          6. (<)a(>) is how you create a link to another webpage.
        <br>
          7 (<)strong(>) is another way to make your text <strong>bold</strong>.
      <h4>Block Elements</h4>
          1. (<)p(>) will put all the text between the opening and closing tag
          in paragraph form.
        <br>
          2. (<)div(>) groups the content between the opening and closing tag inside
            an invisible box.
        <br>
          3. (<)form(>) creates a form for the user to input information.
      <h4>Other Important Concepts</h4>
          1. Keep your code clean and organized. You want it to be easy to read
          and see where one concept begins and ends. Indenting when you begin a
          new idea is a great way to keep it easy to read.
        <br>
          2. Computers interpret your code literally. You have to make sure you
          are clearly telling the computer exactly how you want things to be
          displayed and processed.
